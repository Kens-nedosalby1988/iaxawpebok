OMG, just finished Death of a Unicorn and I have soooo many mixed feelings right now. It’s like, what even was that journey? 🤯 I mean, it starts off like it’s gonna be your usual quirky fantasy, right? Some magical realism vibes and BOOM, hits you with this emotional rollercoaster. It was like the director threw darts at a board of genres. 

And the main character! Ugh, don’t even get me started. There were moments I wanted to punch them and then help them all at once. So much angst yet relatable in this weird, existential kinda way. Like, I get it, life is confusing and messy, but wow, babes, get it together! You feel me?

> Seriously, though, the ending? WHAT THE...I was like sitting there, popcorn no longer a concern, just staring at the screen, wondering if maybe I missed some deep metaphor or something. Or maybe the writers just wanted to mess with us. Either way, hey writer, mission accomplished. Mission freaking accomplished! 😜

And the soundtrack! You ever hear a song that just like makes you feel all nostalgia and weirdly comforted? I think one of those tracks was some 80s synthwave throwback. I dunno, maybe I was too busy drowning in my own thoughts.

Also, I think at one point, I remember thinking, “Did I actually download the movie or is this some fever dream concocted from too much social media and not enough sleep?” 🤣 Love that for me. 

Anyway, I gotta say, despite the crazy twists, it’s one of those you’d tell a friend, “Bruh, you’ve gotta watch the movie.” Even if only to have someone else groan with how absurd some moments were! 😂

Ahh, look at me, losing my mind here. I should probably go unwind or something, let my brain just chill. Let's chat later and dissect this chaos some more, yeah? 🥴 Seriously, hit me up if you decide you wanna embrace the madness and watch it too.
